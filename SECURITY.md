Hey, not sure how to contact people on here for questions or requests. I was reaching out in regard to your work and skills regarding Sven Co-op. 

I've got an issue I'm trying to square away (carrying weapons over during level changes when playing SC solo on original story or Op4, haven't had any luck trying to implement the AS file
you made, but I'm also a dummy when it comes to coding and such).

The other thing I was trying to see about would be if you know of a script/file that would modify stats for SC weapons (mp5, m249, uzi, m40, beretta, m16), or would be able and willing
to assist? Let me know if you can help with either or/or both, thanks! -Cameron
